Hi there! üëã

I am a first-year Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in robotics at the University of Pennsylvania. 

My motivation towards a career in robotics began with a philosophical question ‚Äî how do
we emulate consciousness? The abilities that allow us humans to generalize skills and adapt to un-
certainty have captivated and eluded generations of engineers, scientists and thinkers. I want to help
realize a significant breakthrough that would enable autonomous systems to convincingly emulate human behavior and introduce
a paradigm shift in society. 

Previously I have engaged in research at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov) in NASA and at the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org) in Carnegie Mellon University. Our work on tree-based informative path planning ([TIGRIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12830)) was published in IROS'22. At AWS I worked on [DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) - an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test RL models by racing on a physical race track. 

I am also an adventure junkie who loves exploring places off-the-beaten path. I am a PADI Open Water certified diver üê†, amateur rock-climber üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and working on my Private Pilot's License (PPL) üõ©Ô∏è.
